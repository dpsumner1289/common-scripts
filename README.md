# common-scripts

This is just a collection of quick and useful scripts that can easily be customized/modified to use on any website using JavaScript, and in the case of .php files, WordPress. 

I wrote all of the jQuery whilst having jQuery version 1.12.4 installed, so make sure you at least are up to date with that.

If you have any questions on any of the code or functions, feel free to email me @ dpsumner1289@gmail.com.
